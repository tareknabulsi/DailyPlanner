My first independent Android project. This is a simple application capable of assisting a user to plan his or her daily tasks throughout the year. The application writes files to the phone storage that correspond to a specific date. The current date's task list is also shown by default to the main screen of the app. Notes from the text are parsed into a list format for easy legibility.
